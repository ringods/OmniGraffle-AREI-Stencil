# OmniGraffle Stencil containing the Belgium Electrical AREI symbols

This project contains the script to convert the Belgium Electrical AREI symbols in SVG format to an OmniGrafle stencil.

The SVG source version of the symbols are made available by https://www.shadowhunter.co.uk[Shadowhunter]. The script used to convert from SVG to the stencil can be found https://github.com/m-radzikowski/omnigraffle-stencil[here].

The files in the Releases section contain the direct to use stencils for OmniGraffle.

## Running

Since the conversion script is a Python package, this project creates a local project setup using https://python-poetry.org[Poetry], the modern Python package & virtual environment manager. To run the script, make sure you have Poetry installed on your machine, then run:

```sh
$ poetry install
```

First download the upstream elements archive at https://www.shadowhunter.co.uk/nl/downloads.php
Then unzip, resize and convert the SVG images:

```sh
$ unzip nl_arei_visio_svg_autocad_elmt.zip
$ poetry run resize
$ poetry run omnigraffle-stencil --svg-dir ./SVG-Resized --stencil-file AREI.gstencil
```
